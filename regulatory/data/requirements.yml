  title: Optimization or calc parameters checks
  system_requirements: []
  description: The software shall automatically perform checks on Optimization or calc parameters based on TG-275 recommendations
  specifications: |
    The department protocol will be provided to the software in a configuration
     file. The software will extract the parameters of used for calculation and optimization
    from the TPS Scripting Environment.

  title: TP-Q4a-4 Calculation algorithm
  system_requirements: []
  description: The software shall automatically check that the algorithm used for calculation is correct based on department protocol
  specifications: |
    The department protocol will be provided to the software in a configuration file. The software will extract the algorithm used for calculation
    from the TPS Scripting Environment. It will compare the algorithm defined in the protocol to the algorithm actually used.

    In the report generated, the result of the comparison will be provided. Clearly highlighting a issue of the algorithms are found to be different.

  title: Report Generation
  system_requirements: []
  description: A report will be generated displaying the results of the automated checks
  specifications: |
    The report will list each check performed. Results of automatic checks will be highlighted
    displaying passing checks in green, warnings in orange and failures in red.

    Data points which weren't automatically checked and require manual review will be 
    highlighted in blue.

    The report will be generated and saved in PDF format.
