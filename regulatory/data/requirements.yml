  title: TP-Q4a-4 Calculation algorithm
  system_requirements: []
  description: The software shall automatically check that the algorithm used for calculation is correct based on department protocol
  specifications: |
    The department protocol will be provided to the software in a configuration file. The software will extract the algorithm used for calculation
    from the TPS Scripting Environment. It will compare the algorithm defined in the protocol to the algorithm actually used.

    In the report generated, the result of the comparison will be provided. Clearly highlighting a issue of the algorithms are found to be different.
