- SB reached out to from Innolitics about RDM example repo
- Interested in joining efforts but wait until some progress has been made
- IEC-62304 requires use of a QMS. For exempt clinical decision support software a QMS is still needed, but the TGA does not require this QMS to be certified.
- ISO 13485 for QMS, GitHub can be used to fulfil
- Linking between requirements and testing and code providing functionality
- RDM can use Git hooks to achieve this (commits link to issues)
- Is example repo still needed given overall groups shift?
- Is RDM still useful for example repo?
- Templates for documentation (European Standards):
  https://openregulatory.com/templates/
- Try out RDM, can abandon after a few sessions if determined to be too
  complicated
- 12.1 Essential Principle 13.2, 13.3 (states that current version number needs
  to be available in software itself)
- Proceed with example repo, using RDM and poetry initially
