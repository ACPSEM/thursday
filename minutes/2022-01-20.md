## Poetry installation

- Following steps on https://python-poetry.org/docs/
- Rob performing installation steps on a Linux system
- Using Python 3.9.2
- Run: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -`
- Run: `source $HOME/.poetry/env`
- Switch to main branch, git pull!, and create a new branch: `git checkout -b poetry init`
- Run `poetry --help`
- Initialise poetry with `poetry init`
- Poetry helps you lock dependencies in scenarios where you should lock, but unlock in those where you shouldn't
- Run `poetry install`
- Run `poetry add pydicom`
- Run `poetry add rdm`
- Run `poetry run rdm init`
- Commit changes to repo `git add -A`
- .gitignore is restrictive, new files aren't being added
- RF to determine how to allow entire nested tree in restricted .gitignore
- Also need to add file type: .yml, .png, .jpg, .tex and Makefile
