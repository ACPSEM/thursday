## open discussion
- too much complexity in software development could disincentivise medical physicists
- the new CTG includes sections on AI and automation: these are in the remit of an MP
- training in this area should start early (e.g. during studies)

## set-up of MDs workstation
Getting poetry set-up:
- encountered error related for proxy settings: "SSLError..." from pip inside `poetry install`
Attemps to fix:
  - add "trusted host" to pip configuration?
    `pip config -v list` returns nothing (this is a problem!)
  - make new configuration file at `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\pip\pip.ini`
    add a new line: `[global] trusted-host = pypi.org files.pythonhosted.org`
  - now `pip config -v list` returns the above line (this is good!)
  - try to re-install poetry
    `python install-poetry.py`
    still returns an error, it seems like it might be looking elsewhere for pip configuration 
  - it is possible to try to install from git (with `--git` tag)
  - decision: leave this for now (we need SB!)

## progress with AQs workstation set-up
- needed to authorise VS code to use github account
- putting through a pull request
