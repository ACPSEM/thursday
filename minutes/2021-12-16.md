- complexity of repo? opt for simpler so as not to dissuade members, or?

  - MJ suggests fully-featured/complex repo, document well, and consider additional educational options (workshops, etc.)
  - RF agrees a good idea. Queried the usefulness of two repos.

- SB's minimal things needs for repo:

  - linting/auto-formatting:

    - `pylint`
    - `black`
    - `isort`

  - repo security:

    - `pre-commit` (runs a set of git hooks upon run of git commit)
    - `.gitignore` in allow-list mode
    - `nbstripout` (helps ensure no Jupyter notebook outputs that make contain patient data make it into repo)

  - dependency management / release management

    - `poetry`

  - CI/CD
    - `pytest`

- what to include in `pre-commit`?:

  - `nbstripout`
  - `black`
  - `isort`

- REPO ACTIONS PERFORMED:

  - `poetry init`

    - makes `poetry.toml`

  - `poetry install`
    - makes a python environment

- ACTIONS (all):
