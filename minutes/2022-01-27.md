# 2022-01-27

## Actions before next meeting
- MJ to contact Kiera (RT with RaySearch): discuss ideas around TPS script. Plan QA (TG-275)?
- PC and RF to work on regulatory markdown documents

## poetry

- Solved issue with adding specific nested directory tree exemption to .gitignore:
    ```
    !regulatory/
    !regulatory/**
    ```

## RDM

- Initialised RDM git hooks, run `poetry run rdm hooks`
- Discussed potential for meeting with Innolitics (RDM authors):
    - gain better understanding of regulatory requirements, how RDM solves these issues, etc.
- Investigate RDM markdown documents that were created in last meeting (using `poetry run rdm init`; in regulatory/)
    - Can create documentation, run `make` (in regulatory/)
        - Minor changes required to make file: add `poetry run` before `rdm` commands
- Regulatory aspects of software development is most unclear


## TGA

- Currently unclear how to categorise (radiation oncology) decision support software

## Discussion of software used in demonstration repo

- Need to make a final decision about what type of software we are building
    - TPS script is ideal: largest use case in clinical medical physics [Raystation TPS]
    - Simple enough to be easily managable, complex enough to demonstrate coding practices
    - Showcase useful tools: poetry, rdm, git, etc.
    - Include tools for working with DICOM (e.g. pydicom)
- Final decisions:
    - TP-Q4a-4, TP-Q4a-5 from AAPM TG-275 [plan checking scripts]

## Actions/discussions for next meeting

- Go through regulatory documentation to fill out markdown files
- Simulate a release using RDM
- Workshop for other college members
    - Regularly occuring: ~1x per year (for new students, registrars, etc.)
